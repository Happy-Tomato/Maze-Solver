# Maze-Solver

This is a project made in Python using the Tkinter GUI Toolkit. 
THe Algorithm used for the path finding is "Dijsktra's Algorithm" which was invented by Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956.

An Update will be coming soon wherein you can upload an image of a Maze (eg.That taken from the papers or a book) to the program and it will automatically solve it for you and give you the output.
